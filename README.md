# Let's Sue COINBASE
Need victims of Coinbase to join class-action lawsuit.  Important:  this will concern those who have lost funds whlle transferring USDT to Coinbase.  If I can gather at least 500 victims, I will lead the search for appropriate attorney.

14 Feb 2021, I became the latest victim, losing over $16,000 transferring (accidentally) USDT to Coinbase.

As with many others before me, Coinbase is not responding.

Our USDT transfers were successfully sent to Coinbase, therefore, Coinbase has a method of receiving them and storing them.

Therefore, their excuse for not returning our USDT is a lie.

Coinbase should be sued for recompensation, and for punitive damages.

I need at least 500 fellow victims willing to join in and make Coinbase pay.
